# 🌀 OpenFOAM + Python Examples

Welcome! This repository is a growing collection of examples and mini-projects that combine the power of **OpenFOAM** for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with the flexibility and automation capabilities of **Python**.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

This project explores how Python can enhance the OpenFOAM workflow through:

- 🛠️ Automating case setup and execution
- 📊 Pre- and post-processing simulation data
- 🧠 Integrating with Python tools for data analysis, visualization, or machine learning

Each example is designed to be:

- Minimal and easy to understand
- Well-commented and adaptable
- Focused on learning and experimentation

## 💡 Why?

Working with OpenFOAM often involves repetitive tasks and a lot of manual work. Python helps to streamline that process—making your simulations faster to set up, easier to analyze, and more powerful when combined with modern data tools.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Browse the folders to find examples you’re interested in. Each example typically includes:

- A brief description
- The necessary OpenFOAM case files
- Python scripts for automation or analysis
- Notes or instructions for reproducing the results
